# Python_BikeShare_Project
Python Codes for the BikeShare App for the Udacity Course

This repo has the python codes for the Bikeshare app. This app will provide data on the most popular bikeshare stations, trip duration, and user statistics in a US City by month and day of the week. It does so by loading in three .csv files and prompting users to specify which city and dates that they want to view statstics for. The output provides descriptive statstics on users in that city and time period such as user type (subscriber or day-use customer), gender, birth year, as well as information about their trip such as duration and route. 

Note that the file uses 'chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv', all of which arent included in this repo and should be accessed from the Udacity course website. I've included the script here as an example of writing a simple user interactive application.
